# SatIndustry - Technical Answers to Real-World Problems (TARP) Project

**VIT Vellore | [Year: 2025]**

## Overview

SatIndustry is a web application developed as a part of the Technical Answers to Real-World Problems (TARP) initiative at VIT Vellore. This project harnesses the power of satellite data and advanced AI techniques to provide insightful environmental monitoring and analysis.  SatIndustry aims to bridge the gap between complex satellite imagery and accessible, actionable information for a range of users, from environmental enthusiasts to industry professionals.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of SatIndustry are:

*   **Real-time Environmental Monitoring:** To create a platform that provides up-to-date information on key environmental indicators such as weather conditions and air quality.
*   **Satellite Data Analysis:** To leverage satellite imagery to analyze and visualize environmental changes, particularly focusing on vegetation patterns and anomalies.
*   **Accessibility and User-Friendliness:** To design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes complex satellite data and analysis accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.
*   **Practical Application for Real-World Issues:** To address real-world environmental concerns by providing data-driven insights that can inform decision-making and promote environmental awareness.

## Key Features

SatIndustry incorporates the following core features:

*   **Interactive Mapping Interface:** A dynamic map powered by Leaflet.js, allowing users to explore geographic locations and visualize environmental data overlays.
*   **Real-time Weather Data:** Integration with weather APIs to display current temperature and other relevant weather parameters for selected locations.
*   **Air Quality Monitoring:**  Display of Air Quality Index (AQI) and pollutant levels, providing users with immediate insights into air quality conditions.
*   **Historical Temperature Analysis:**  Interactive charts visualizing historical temperature trends over the past two decades, enabling users to observe climate patterns.
*   **Vegetation Change Detection:**  Utilizing Planet Labs satellite imagery to analyze vegetation changes over time using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), offering insights into environmental health and land use dynamics.
*   **Planet Imagery Display:**  Visualization of both recent and historical RGB satellite imagery from Planet Labs, allowing users to visually compare land conditions across different time periods.
*   **User Location and Search Functionality:**  Features to automatically detect user location and search for specific places, making data retrieval seamless and location-centric.
*   **Layer Toggling:**  Options to toggle different data layers (clouds, wind, AQI) on the map, providing users with control over visualized information.

## Technology Stack

SatIndustry is built using a robust and modern technology stack:

*   **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Leaflet, Chart.js) for an interactive and visually engaging user interface.
*   **Backend:** Python with the Django framework, providing a scalable and secure server-side environment.
*   **Database:** SQLite for development and potential scalability with other database systems.
*   **APIs:** Integration with OpenWeatherMap API for weather data, World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API for air quality information, and Planet Labs API for satellite imagery analysis.
*   **Mapping Library:** Leaflet.js for creating interactive maps.
*   **Charting Library:** Chart.js for dynamic data visualization.

## Team Members

*   **Tarush Agarwal:** Full Stack Developer and AI Engineer - Architect of machine learning pipelines and satellite data analysis systems.
*   **Ishanvi Mishra:** AI & ML Engineer - Specialist in emission pattern recognition and regulatory compliance analysis.
*   **Ansh Chaturvedi:** Environmental Data Scientist - Developer of the real-time monitoring platform and data visualization tools.

## Project Status

Work in Progress

## Future Enhancements

Potential future developments for SatIndustry include:

*   **Advanced Analytics:** Implementing more sophisticated AI/ML models for predictive environmental analysis and anomaly detection.
*   **Expanded Data Layers:** Integrating additional environmental datasets, such as water quality indices, deforestation rates, and biodiversity metrics.
*   **User Accounts and Personalization:**  Adding user accounts to enable personalized dashboards, saved locations, and custom data alerts.
*   **Mobile Application Development:**  Developing a mobile app version of SatIndustry for enhanced accessibility and on-the-go environmental monitoring.
*   **Integration of Additional Satellite Data Sources:**  Exploring and incorporating data from other satellite providers to broaden data coverage and analytical capabilities.
